# Indirect-Bystander
Repository for Indirect Radiation-Induced Bystander Paper
There are two main datasets for this paper, the first investigates effect of radiation on pheromone emissions and how "soild" housing materials contained pheromones from irradiated populations could affect non-irradiated populations. The second investigates the effect of biophotons in development, and whether or not radiation affects the quality and quantity of biophotons produced.
